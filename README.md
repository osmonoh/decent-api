# REST API

This is my first backend project where I created a small REST API with frontend page introducing the API, offering some interactive examples of requests and responses, as well as documentation. These are some of the technologies and approaches employed in the project:

- MVC design pattern
- Node.js with Express
- EJS template engine
- DOM API with JavaScript
- plain CSS for styling

This project is inspired by and based on [ReqRes](https://reqres.in/) and [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/). It is serving some scientific classification and nutrition data for fruits, based on data from [Fruityvice](https://www.fruityvice.com/).
